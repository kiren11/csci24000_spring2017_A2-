Algoritm:

Flow chart:
	1) Starts in int main()
	2) Need to pass two pointers to Player A function and Player Bs function
	3) Values are changed and then passed to printPosition


Steps:
	1)Introduction
	2)Get time
	3)Make two variables initialized to zero so it can be passed in by reference
	4) WhilePass the two variables in corresponding player function 
	5)Value of zero gets passed
	6)Generate random number 
	7)Figure out what range of numbers equals what probability
		a)So I took like 20%, and multiplied 0.2 by 50 to get how many spaces would equal that obstacle
	8) Create a conditional for each probability
	9) Move each pointer in corresponding direction, left or right using + and -
		a) Create a condition where if the position is less than one, the pointer gets reset to position 1
		b) Create another condition where the pointer value goes over 50, then it just resets back to 50
	10) Pass that pointer value to printPosition so it can display it
	11) If both pointers equal the same value, then move Player A’s position back one by subtracting one
	12) If player A’s position is bigger than B’s, then print A at its pointer value
		a) Then print B’s value by subtracting A’s value from it
	13) Do vice versa for Player B


Also:
	1) To make the program run again, put it in a while loop where it keeps running if the player says yes
	2) Use setw from <iomanip> to put spaces between both Player letters


Then to see who won:
	1) When one of the players gets to the value 50, and the race ends, see which value of which player is bigger
		a) If A’s is bigger, than say you won
		b) If B’s is bigger, then say try harder
